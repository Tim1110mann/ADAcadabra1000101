    <h1>Pre-processing our data - Features & Character tropes</h1>
    <div class="body-content">
        <h2>Character Tropes</h2>
            <p>
                Before we have fun analyzing the data, we should probably get on the same page on the terms of our question of interest. 
                What are the actor features do we want to analyse? 
                What character tropes are we using for our categories?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As mentionned in our <a href="https://tim1110mann.github.io/ADAcadabra1000101/resources.html">Ressources</a> page we are using the dataset provided by the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, collected by David Bamman, Brendan O'Connor, and Noah Smith. 
                This dataset provides us with lots of interesting data on more than 42 000 movies such as the actors and their roles in each movie, their box office numbers, the movie genres and more.
                Let's start by determining our character tropes from this data.                
            </p>
            <p>
                The CMU Corpus provides us with 72 character tropes, based of <a href="https://tvtropes.org/">TVTropes.org</a>, with 501 characters manually categorised in each.
                We can view the distribution of these characters in the graph below.
                <img src="preprocessing_graphs/characters_per_trope.png" alt="Characters per Trope">
            </p>
            <p>
                Our first reaction seeing this graph was "Wow, there are a lot of crazy jealous guys in movies!" followed by "Why does no one want to be a classy cat burglar?".
                Jokes aside, the graph shows how unbalanced the distribution of characters per trope in our initial dataset. 
                Indeed, with only one or two characters per trope at times, it would be quite impossible to come to unbiased conclusions regarding these tropes. 
                It would be quite easy for us to say that if you don't have the same features as the actor playing the classy cat burglar trope, your dreams of playing that trope are as good as dead.
                Luckily for you (and for us), we decided against this easy way out.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Using our movie knowledge and the descriptions provided by <a href="https://tvtropes.org/">TVTropes.org</a>, we regrouped similar tropes together, creating larger archetypes. 
                Some tropes were easy to group together, such as the <code>klutz</code> and the <code>ditz</code>. 
                We tried to come up with names that best encapsulated the different features of these combined tropes.
                All in all, we utimately came up with 16 unique character archetypes. From now on, when we will refer to <i>character tropes</i>, we will refer to these 16 archetypes:
                <ul>
                    <li> <code> skilled_badass </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> loser </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> laidback_freebird </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> jock </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> charismatic_charmer </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> respected_leader </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> crazy_fighter </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> dumb_and_clumsy </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> shallow_and_popular </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> old_wise_quirky </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> sidekick </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> emotional_damage </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> evil_character </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> mean_officer </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> tech_genius </code> </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We can plot the number of characters per trope to observe their distribution as we did before.
                <img src="preprocessing_graphs/characters_per_newgrped_tropes.png" alt="Characters per (New) Tropes">
            </p>
            <p>
                There is now at least a dozen characters per trope, giving us a much better sample size to base our analysis on.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                The results of this first step were that, courtesy of Bamman, O'Connor and Smith's work, we were able to identify 16 unique character tropes represented across 501 movies:
                
                This narrowed our field of view and allowed us to focus on these 501 movies. In these narrowed dataset, we observe 335 unique actors, each playing roles that fit in one or more tropes.
            </p>
            <p> "Show plot of tropes representation across the 501 movies here."</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We identified a set of features to define our actors.:
                <ul>
                    <li> <code> ActorGender </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> ActorAge </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> ActorHeight </code> </li>
                    <li> <code> Facial Encodings </code> </li>
                </ul>
                We decided to not keep the variable <i>Actor Ethnicity</i> as there was just too many missing values (over 30%). 
                We could not find a suitable database to complete our data.
