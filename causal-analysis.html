            Welcome to Supervised Learning!
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope the <a href="https://tim1110mann.github.io/ADAcadabra1000101/unsupervised-learning.html">Unsupervised Learning</a> narrator didn't say anything too mean to you while you were over there.
            Oh, you came to me first? That's awfully kind of you :).
            Anyway, enough blabbing around, let's dive straight in!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From our <a href="https://tim1110mann.github.io/ADAcadabra1000101/preprocessing.html">pre-processing</a>, we defined the key terms of our main question, the<b>features</b> and the <b>character tropes</b>.
            In this chapter, we are opting for a more causal approach.
            In other words, given an input <code>X</code>, we can find the output <code>y</code> via a function <code>f(X)</code>, with <code>f(X)</code> being the main mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can apply this approach to our case and define our input <code>X</code> as the set of features we defined a chapter ago and our output <code>y</code> as our 16 unique character tropes.
            We would like to "learn" the function <code>f</code> that links the two such that <code>f(X) = y</code>.
            Who knows? We might even be able to have fun after having found this function, like figure out what kind of trope I would play!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As we have a discrete y, each character trope represents a separate and independent category, we have to go with classification.
            We go\ through various methods to find our <code>f(X)</code> such as decision trees, kNN, linear and logistic regression and supervised neural netowrks.
